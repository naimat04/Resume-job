            <p>Hi there, my name is Nimaullah.

                I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Geophysics at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My
                research project is centered around a fascinating area of study: the modeling and inversion of
                cross-well ERT data for monitoring CO2 injection into the ground.

                During a summer internship at IIT Bombay, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in
                geophysical exploration techniques. Under the mentorship of Prof. Anand Singh, I worked on a project
                focused on using magnetic and VLF surveys to locate groundwater sources.

                Over the course of two months, I delved deep into geophysical survey methods, particularly magnetic and
                VLF techniques. I learned how to operate specialized equipment to collect data from the subsurface. This
                involved setting up surveys, taking measurements, and ensuring data accuracy.

                Once we collected the data, the next step was to process it. I applied various data processing
                techniques to clean and organize the raw data. This was crucial for preparing the data for analysis.

                Using computational tools, I conducted inversion modeling of the processed data. This involved creating
                mathematical models to interpret the data and extract insights about subsurface geological structures.
                It was like putting together pieces of a puzzle to understand what lies beneath the surface.

                One of the most rewarding aspects of the internship was the detailed interpretation of the inverted data
                to locate potential water sources. This required careful analysis and critical thinking to identify
                promising locations for groundwater exploration.</p>
